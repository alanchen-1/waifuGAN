# waifuGAN

This is a waifuGAN, a DCGAN network trained to generate anime faces, implemented in PyTorch with data taken from [zerochan.net](https://www.zerochan.net/) and cropped using OpenCV. Read the full blog post here: [link](https://alanchen-1.github.io/posts/waifuGAN.html).

## Changelog: 
9/27/2021 - Moved entire README into a blog post onto my GitHub Pages. Check it out above. 

## Notes:
1. Check out blog post for links to dataset.
2. Models are in the models folder.
3. Plans for a webtool are coming soon, going to use ONNX.js.
4. Additionally, I scraped a ton more data from e-shuushuu.net, another free repository of data. Going to train again, and with more epochs (whenever I can find time to let my laptop overheat for a bit, busy college student rn).
