# waifuGAN

This is a waifuGAN, a DCGAN network trained to generate anime faces, implemented in PyTorch with data taken from [zerochan.net](https://www.zerochan.net/), [shuushuu](https://e-shuushuu.net/), and cropped using OpenCV.

## Example Images
Here are some handpicked examples of the newly trained and updated model (1/9/2022):

## Changelog: 
1/9/2022 - Uploaded new model and updated blog with new info. 

9/27/2021 - Moved entire README into a blog post onto my GitHub Pages. Check it out above. 

## Old Notes:
1. Check out blog post for links to dataset.
2. Models are in the models folder.
3. ~~Plans for a webtool are coming soon, going to use ONNX.js.~~
4. Additionally, I scraped a ton more data from e-shuushuu.net, another free repository of data. Going to train again, and with more epochs (whenever I can find time to let my laptop overheat for a bit, busy college student rn). Update (1/9/2022): Done!
